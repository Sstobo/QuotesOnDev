# Quotes on Dev Project 

A WordPress project using JS, Jquery, Ajax and PHP. Quotes on Dev randomly pulls a post from and displays it. 

## Learnings

This project felt quite natural for me. The wordpress frame is becoming more workable, as I am understanding taxonomys, templates, and the general lay of the land better.
I really enjoyed getting back into JS and Jq this project.
I think the different methods of pulling data from an API where my biggest discoverys this time around.

### Hurdles

There were some slightly tricky factors in this project. The javascript was challenging, but understandable. The real challenge, similar to my last projects, was the sheer amount of time CSS takes. Good thing i enjoy it!


### Notes

I still have some tweaks to make to the archive/ catagories page. These will be a focus this week.

### Everything else

Thanks Scott and Colin! We had a great collaborative coding session together.
